Since I&#x2019;m the one who introduced financial engineering to Quebec&#x2019;s market, I&#x2019;m obviously the first to encourage its use. Besides, it&#x2019;s really common, in multifamily real estate coachings, to teach how to maximize leverage through &#x201C;creative financing.&#x201D; However, it&#x2019;s important to use your good judgment when using this technique. In fact, <strong>it&#x2019;s the easiest way to generate massive wealth but is also the easiest way to lose a lot of money.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/skillset.svg\"><span>Definition</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>Leverage consists in borrowing money to buy a building, so it produces greater return than what the loan cost itself. Therefore, the profits made through debt become greater than the debt value.</p>\n<p>An investor who buys a building with just 25% down payment uses, consequently, a 75% leverage, also known as loan-to-value ratio.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>For instance, according to a common misconception, interest rate would be the most important part of a mortgage. However, a skillful investor knows that, depending on his profile and his strategy, other aspects are as just as important, if not more so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>debt coverage ratio (DCR)</li>\n<li>loan-to-value ratio (LTV ratio), the term</li>\n<li>qualifying rate</li>\n<li>necessary net worth and guarantee</li>\n<li>amortization</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CHOOSE YOUR MORTGAGE CLEVERLY</h3>\n<p>As you read through this text, I imagine you frown. You think the less interest you pay the more money you put into your pockets. Well, you&#x2019;re not completely wrong. However, according to this mindset you engage in short-term thinking and you overlook the possible refinancing risks.</p>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s consider the example of a CMHC-insured multifamily loan, for a 6-unit building, purchased $609,000. It generates $50,000 of income the first year and $54,000 the fifth year. The building&#x2019;s economic value (EV) is equivalent to the amount paid and the granted loan will be $517,000, i.e. 85%.</p>\n<p>The first year, the DCR used to establish the EV is only 1.10. That&#x2019;s to say, for each dollar of the mortgage monthly cost, the building should generate $1.10 after standardizing all expenditures. On the other hand, five years later at the time of refinancing, the CMHC will require a DCR of 1.20.</p>\n<p>At the end of the term, there will be a $483,000 mortgage balance. When refinancing five years later, with a 1.20 DCR, the amount of the new loan will be $511,000. Also, you have $28,000 to buy a new property. So far so good!</p>\n<p>Now, let&#x2019;s apply risk management on the assumption that the interest rate has increased by 1%. DISASTER! The amount of the new loan is only $452,000! Consequently, the bank will require a new down payment to compensate for the difference between the first mortgage balance and the refinancing. Therefore, you would have to pay $31,000 from your pockets to keep a building purchased five years ago, without counting the first five years&#x2019; loss of capitalization.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/analytics.svg\"><span>Scenarios</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Stable interest rate</span><ul><li><span>Loan when financing</span><span> $517,000</span></li><li><span>Balance at the end of the term</span><span> $483,000</span></li><li><span>Loan when refinancing</span><span> $511,000</span></li><li><span>Money available</span><span> $28,000</span></li></ul></div><div class=\"scenario\"><span>+1% interest rate</span><ul><li><span>Loan when financing</span><span> $517,000</span></li><li><span>Balance at the end of the term</span><span> $483,000</span></li><li><span>Loan when refinancing</span><span> $452,000</span></li><li><span>Money available</span><span> -$31,000</span></li></ul></div></div></div>\n<p>Now, do you see better what I mean? Here are 5 ways to reduce risks associated to leverage that you can already apply!</p>\n<h3>1. Model the&#xA0;EV at the End of Your First Mortgage Term</h3>\n<p>The above example brings us to the first way to reduce risks: assess the EV at the end of the mortgage term. In fact, it&#x2019;s insufficient to establish the current EV before buying a building. You should also calculate the potential future EV. This is modelling and for those who cannot do so by themselves, will find the next decade in multifamily real estate really harsh, believe me!</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/skillset.svg\"><span>Definition</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>EV are calculated according to the maximum loan a building can take out, while satisfying the bank conservative criteria. Every building will have its own EV depending on the banking institution and its economic parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incomes minus the area vacancy rate (CMHC establishes percentages)</li>\n<li>Actual expenditures + standardized expenditures (management fees and janitorial service fees, as if the building were being run by a third party, maintenance fees).</li>\n<li>Qualifying rates (generally higher than the nominal interest rate)</li>\n<li>DCR (the debt coverage ratio represents the link between the normalized net income and the monthly or annual debt cost, also known as debt service, which varies generally between 1.10 and 1.30).</li>\n<li>LTV ratio (the loan-to-value ratio represents the maximum amount a banking institution would consider acceptable as leverage. Generally, it&#x2019;s between 75% and 80% for a conventional loan and 85% for a CMHC-insured loan.)</li>\n<li>Amortization, i.e. the number of years on which one calculates the loan repayment (25&#x2013;40 years).</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n<h3>2. Consider the Option of a 10 Years Term</h3>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce risk associated to refinancing is to consider a longer term. In Quebec, people take, generally, a 5-year term; I suppose it&#x2019;s a trend. However, in the United States, most of my clients choose a 10-year term and so do the wealthiest investors too. In the above example, a 10-year term would prevent adverse consequences due to the mortgage interest rate increase.</p>\n<h3>3. An Active Portfolio Management</h3>\n<p>At the MREX College, in our classes and program &#x201C;La meute multilogements,&#x201D; we constantly repeat to our students that they shouldn&#x2019;t realize the building&#x2019;s financial analysis only on purchase. Actually, they should do it each year, even every trimester. The best way to anticipate risky situations is to manage your real estate portfolio actively. Therefore, it allows necessary adjustments to be made like: increasing the rent, saving money, finding new financial partners at the right moment in a planned, effective and efficient manner.</p>\n<h3>4. Contingency Fund</h3>\n<p>An excellent way to reduce risk associated to leverage is to form a contingency fund partly made up of your building&#x2019;s cash flow and your own monthly savings. In the case a building doesn&#x2019;t allow you to create such a fund, it means that it doesn&#x2019;t correspond to your investor profile.</p>\n<h3>5. Partnership</h3>\n<p>The last way is to join forces, because two investors allow to divide the risk, to increase purchasing power, and to obtain better financing or refinancing conditions. In addition, bank faces a lower risk, because it takes into consideration: 2 net worth, 2 drs and 2 people to provide guarantees jointly.</p>\n<p>Finally, since the last two decades have been productive, even easy, just a few investors understand today&#x2019;s market reality. Indeed, we face a growing risk in multifamily real estate market because of the interest rates increase. Is it a reason to stop investing in real estate? Not necessarily! Is it a reason to use less leverage? Neither! However, we should become, for sure, skillful investors, more than the latest generation.</p>\n<p>This is an adaptation and a free translation of my article &#x201C;6 fa&#xE7;ons de r&#xE9;duire le risque associ&#xE9; au levier en immobilier multilogements&#x201D;,&#xA0;originally published in the magazine: Les mordus d&#x2019;immobiliers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>About the author</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"single_post_author_pic\" class=\"lazy_loading\" data-src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/nikolai-ray-ceo-mrex-280x280.jpg\" style=\"--lazy_loading_low:url(&apos;https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/nikolai-ray-ceo-mrex-80x50.jpg&apos;);\"></div><p>Nikola&#xEF; is the founder and CEO of MREX.

He’s a financial planner, licensed financial security adviser, and a mutual fund representative.","htmlContent":"\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"single_post_content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>April isn&#x2019;t the only time of the year to reduce your taxes, on contrary it&#x2019;s done throughout the year. Sometimes, it&#x2019;s just about setting up a system to save taxes on a long period of time, like the technique proposed in this article: cash damming.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This technique consists, roughly speaking, in converting some personal debts into business debts to take advantage of tax deductions on the interest. In order to do so, you should open an account into which you would deposit your gross revenue in its entirety. From this account you would pay for nondeductible personal expenditures : taxes, groceries, etc. Then, you would open a second account, usually a credit line, with which you would pay exclusively for your business expenditures.</p>\n<p>Since the credit line pays for the business expenditures, there&#x2019;s a surplus in the first account. This amount helps to repay personal loans faster. For instance, if we spend annually $50,000 in personal expenditures a $150,000 personal mortgage on 3 years is conceivable. During these years, you can also accumulate $150,000 in business debt. The difference in this case is that the business debt interest is deductible, whereas the personal mortgage interest are not. So, we want to get rid of this personal debt quickly.&#x201D; Explains Marc-&#xC9;tienne Salvail, financial planner at GestionFTM.</p>\n<p>For example, let&#x2019;s take a look at a $150,000 mortgage loan amortized over 25 years, with a 6% interest rate and a 45% tax rate. Once this debt is converted into a business debt, thanks to cash damming, you would save a total of $62,061 in taxes.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/analytics.svg\"><span>Scenarios</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Amortized over 10 years</span><ul><li><span>Converted personal debts</span><span> $150,000</span></li><li><span>Interest</span><span> $49,172</span></li><li><span>Tax savings</span><span> $22,127</span></li></ul></div><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Amortized over 25 years</span><ul><li><span>Converted personal debts</span><span> $150,000</span></li><li><span>Interest</span><span> $137,913</span></li><li><span>Tax savings</span><span> $62,061</span></li></ul></div></div></div>\n<h3>A Technique To Apply To Many Situations</h3>\n<p>The trick is simple: you should keep the liquidity generated by your gross revenue in order to make your loan payments for which interest is nondeductible and use a credit line to pay for disbursements for which interest is deductible. So this technique can be used in many situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>catch-up for unused RRSP or TFSA contributions</li>\n<li>payment of overdue taxes</li>\n<li>payment of a universal life insurance premium</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, a banking institution will not grant a loan to allow you to contribute to your RRSP or TFSA. On the other hand, it will grant a credit line for your business because it increases at the same rate as your RRSP or TFSA contributions.</p>\n<h3>Conditions To Be Fulfilled</h3>\n<p>This technique can be used by unincorporated self-employed workers, by general partnership partners and by owners of income properties if they are owned personally. You can take advantage of this technique when the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you should be an individual in business whose enterprise is unincorporated</li>\n<li>you earn a high taxable income</li>\n<li>you have significant personal debts (mortgage loan, car loan, credit cards, etc.)</li>\n<li>you have significant business expenditures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>100% Legal, But Not Without Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Cash damming isn&#x2019;t a new strategy and before 2003, one was facing a grey zone when trying to get the most out of this technique. Thus, even though it has been shown to work quite easily, beware of some pitfalls.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/check.svg\"><span>Did you know?</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>The CRA confirmed the validity of the strategy in its response of February 27, 2003, including confirmation of the non-application of the anti-avoidance rule. In addition, in March 2015, the CRA published a first version of the S3-F6-C1 income tax folio, in which it clearly states in paragraph 1.34 of the said folio that this technique is consistent with the wording of the law.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>In the case of a separation, while or after reimbursing the first mortgage on the residence, it would involve some costs associated to the partitioning of the family patrimony. Since everyone&#x2019;s situation is different, there are many different planning strategies based on cash damming technique. Moreover, it&#x2019;s important to note that the credit line must be used solely to pay for business disbursement eligible for interest deduction. That&#x2019;s to say, not every disbursement is eligible!</p>\n<p>To apply this technique without any risk and effectively, it&#x2019;s important to master tax field. Therefore, we highly recommend the assistance of a financial planner before you implement this technique. We&#x2019;ll never state too much that in order to succeed in real estate investment, it&#x2019;s really important to be surrounded by a team of professionals!</p>\n<p>If you do not already have a financial planner or for further information about cash damming, you can reach our partner and consultant for preparing this article: Marc-&#xC9;tienne Salvail at 1&#xA0;877&#xA0;484-6633 extension&#xA0;105 or on the Internet at the following address: <a href=\"http://gestionftm.com\" target=\"_blank\">gestionftm.com</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>About the author</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"single_post_author_pic\" class=\"lazy_loading\" data-src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/marc-etienne-salvail.png\" style=\"--lazy_loading_low:url(&apos;https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/marc-etienne-salvail-80x50.png&apos;);\"></div><p>Marc-&#xC9;tienne is a senior partner at <a href=\"http://www.gestionftm.com/\">GestionFTM</a> and holds a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business administration, finance profile.

In fact, this consists in a second registered loan (subordinated to the bank mortgage) and granted by the multifamily property seller.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/skillset.svg\"><span>Definition</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>When concluding a vendor take-back, the seller lends an amount of the sale price (it&#x2019;s left pending- as a balance) during some years. Consequently, it reduces the amount necessary as a down payment.</p>\n<p>In some regards, a vendor take-back is like a debenture or a bond, which is a second registered loan (subordinated to the bank mortgage), signed before a notary, and published in the Land Register.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>The vendor take-back offers many benefits both for the seller and the buyer. However, many experienced or inexperienced real estate investors aren&#x2019;t able to conclude a transaction with a vendor take-back.</p>\n<p>Here are 7 obstacles which impede a seller to achieve a transaction with a&#xA0;vendor take-back:</p>\n<h3>The Seller Needs All His Money Immediately</h3>\n<p>In the case where a seller needs all the money from the sale immediately, the&#xA0;VTB is virtually impossible. This may be due to 2 scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has bought the building within the last 5 years and he doesn&#x2019;t have enough equity to leave a share of the transaction sale price on the table for a few years.</li>\n<li>The seller&#x2019;s equity is sufficient, but he has a different goal in mind (like buying a business). Therefore, he needs 100% of the liquidity generated by the sale of his income property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Supply And Demand Versus Market Value</h3>\n<p>In such a market like the multifamily real estate, it&#x2019;s all a matter of supply and demand. So, if the demand is high (many active buyers), but the supply is low (not so many buildings on sale), it&#x2019;ll be difficult for a buyer to conclude a&#xA0;vendor take-back. The price offered for the building, based on the market value, will have a major impact too. For instance, if you offer 10% below the market value and you&#x2019;re not the only one interested in buying the building, your chances to achieve a&#xA0;vendor take-back are quite poor.</p>\n<h3>Your Broker and Yourself Are Unable to Highlight the Vendor Take-Back Advantages to the Seller</h3>\n<p>First of all, you have to persuade the seller that this kind of loan will benefit him too. Apart from convincing him of the advantages, you&#x2019;ll have to persuade him to trust you. Therefore, you must rely on your credibility as a real estate investor to prove that you&#x2019;ll be able to repay the debt. Some aspects may help you to convince the seller to accept a VTB: your net worth, your credit file, your professional achievements and how you introduce yourself. As for the banker, you should convince him too, since he grants you a first rank loan.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/check.svg\"><span>Did you know?</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>By agreeing to a vendor take-back, the seller manages risks. He must ponder whether the VTB is more advantageous than the risk of not receiving a full repayment.</p>\n<p>For example, if you suggest a VTB which represents 100% of the down payment, the seller will wonder why he would take all the risks. (This is an example of what not to do!)</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>If neither you nor your real estate broker masters the&#xA0;vendor take-back concept, you&#x2019;ll be unable to persuade the seller. Therefore, you should always make sure that a real estate broker represents you. Also, he should hold the right permit depending on the number of units, the type of building (residential or commercial) and he should also hold the CMS MREX&#x2019;s title.</p>\n<h3>You Chose An Inappropriate First Rank Loan Type</h3>\n<p>Which type of first rank loan you choose will impact significantly whether to achieve a&#xA0;VTB or not. To maximize your chances of success, you should decide if your first rank loan should be insured or conventional.</p>\n<p>That is to say, if the original loan is CMHC-insured, the&#xA0;vendor take-back is still conceivable, even though it&#x2019;s more complex to structure and your chances of success are poorer.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/check.svg\"><span>Did you know?</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>Your banker grants you the first rank loan and he reserves his right to accept or not subordinated debts.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>A Badly Structured Vendor Take-Back</h3>\n<p>How do you plan to reimburse the&#xA0;vendor take-back influences the seller&#x2019;s decision. However, it mostly influences the banker&#x2019;s or the first rank loan holder&#x2019;s decision. For instance, you may wonder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is it a progressive repayment of interest and capital?</li>\n<li>is it a monthly reimbursement of the interest, added to a &#x201C;balloon&#x201D; of capital at the VTB&#x2019;s term?</li>\n<li>is it a payment holiday during the term and a balloon payment (capital and interest) at the end of it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to choose the right structure according to the circumstances, in order to satisfy all parties involved requirements.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/skillset.svg\"><span>Definition</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>With a balloon loan, no payments are required during the term but this kind of loan must be fully reimbursed at the end of the term. As for the buyer, he&#x2019;ll have to pay compound interest annually. That&#x2019;s to say, each year the interest adds to the capital on which new interest is calculated. Hence this loan&#x2019;s name; its balance increases year after year.</p>\n<p>Its principal advantage lies in the liquidity increase during the term, because no payments (neither capital nor interest) are made. However, the buyer will pay a higher price at the end of the term.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Neither Your Account Manager Nor Your Mortgage Broker Has The Expertise In This Kind Of Financial Package</h3>\n<p>Have you ever heard: &#x201C;This bank manager or this mortgage broker claims a&#xA0;vendor take-back is not doable anymore.&#x201D; If so, you likely encountered a financier who has never dealt with a&#xA0;VTB as a second rank loan. Indeed, very few account managers have an experience or an adequate training, and the same could apply to many mortgage brokers. Moreover, bank&#x2019;s computer systems are not conceived to allow&#xA0;vendor take-back. Also, do not hesitate to ask questions, to consult many different professionals even if it means to substitute one of your team members by a more skilled one!</p>\n<h3>For The Specific Case Of Your Transaction, The&#xA0;Vendor Take-Back Is Too Risky</h3>\n<p>Because a mortgage broker claims a&#xA0;vendor take-back is impossible shouldn&#x2019;t push you to change your mortgage broker systematically. Actually, it&#x2019;s important to keep in mind that he may be right! Also, some elements may explain why the&#xA0;VTB is too risky.</p>\n<p>First, the building doesn&#x2019;t allow you to increase the revenue or to cut down on the expenditures sufficiently to release a new sum of money (leverage effect). The kind of money that could help to repay the&#xA0;VTB in case of financial hardships.</p>\n<p>Secondly, you have a precarious salary, job or credit file. Then, it may be insufficient to reimburse the&#xA0;VTB without the additional income you would earn with the building possession.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the presence or not of escape clauses will affect the risk associated to the&#xA0;vendor take-back term (final and full repayment date, resolutive clause).</p>\n<p>The&#xA0;vendor take-back is a powerful tool for a real estate investor who wants to reduce his down payment on purchase and maximize his investments&#x2019; output.

Actually, some investors don&#x2019;t take into account maintenance and future renovations in their standardization exercise. Effectively, it&#x2019;s needless to adjust revenue according to the vacancy rate or based the expenditure items (maintenance, janitorial fees, management, administration, etc.) on market standard if the investors don&#x2019;t adjust the price so it&#x2019;s in line with maintenance and future renovations. We need to recognize that a building depreciates and sooner than later some works will be needed: change doors and windows, upgrade roofing or change kitchen cabinetry.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/check.svg\"><span>Did you know?</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><p>In order to compensate for the building&#x2019;s deterioration, the Income Tax Act (ITA) permits to deduct its cost over a period of several years.

The $100,000 for renovating in two years equals $96,116 and the $100,000 in four years equals $92,384 today.

Affordable investment properties are a staple of the many of Florida&#x2019;s markets, however it&#x2019;s notably true with the Jacksonville housing forecast. According to <a href=\"https://www.realwealthnetwork.com/markets/jacksonville-florida/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real Wealth Networh</a>, the median price of 3 bedroom homes in Jacksonville was $141,000 in January 2018. This is 30% lower than the national average of $202,000. This shows us that property values in Jacksonville are more affordable than many other U.S. cities today. Also, the median monthly rent for 3 bedroom homes was $1,150 in January, which is 0.82% of the $141,000 purchase price.&#xA0;This shows us that the Jacksonville metro area offers investors the opportunity to generate more rental income than many other U.S. cities today.</p>\n<p>Jacksonville also has lower taxes than most of the country &#x2014; zero income tax and a flat corporate tax rate of only 5.5% &#x2014; which are positive factors in creating a strong cash flow opportunity.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about investing in the Jacksonville multifamily real estate market,&#xA0;don&#x2019;t miss our <a href=\"https://mrex.co/en/webinars/key-jacksonville-multifamily-real-estate-trends-for-2019/\">free webinar: Jacksonville Multifamily Real Estate Key Trends for 2019</a>&#xA0;with myself, Nikola&#xEF; Ray, and Gino Barbaro,&#xA0;one of the <a href=\"https://jakeandgino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top real estate podcasters</a> out there and owner of over 1000 units!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>About the author</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"single_post_author_pic\" class=\"lazy_loading\" data-src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/nikolai-ray-ceo-mrex-280x280.jpg\" style=\"--lazy_loading_low:url(&apos;https://mrex.co/le-contenu/fichiers/2019/01/nikolai-ray-ceo-mrex-80x50.jpg&apos;);\"></div><p>Nikola&#xEF; is the founder and CEO of MREX.

With this article, I want to prove how important it is to consider every aspect of your investment. The reason is that the following situation is way too common: a &#x201C;good tenant&#x201D; who has been renting an apartment for many years now and has been taken for granted, this can make the investor losing money.</p>\n<h3>A &#x201C;Good&#x201D; Tenant Versus One Who&#x2019;s &#x201C;Profitable&#x201D; For You</h3>\n<p>Vincent (fictitious name) has just bought an income property. For the past eight years, Vincent has been renting one of his apartments to the same tenant. The latter pays the rent on time doesn&#x2019;t object to the annual increase of his rent, etc. Many investors may think this is a &#x201C;good tenant.&#x201D; Moreover, for some investors this is a golden situation and a landlord should retain this kind of clients. However, in my experience, this is not totally true, nor completely false.</p>\n<p>Actually, in this kind of situation, the apartment is often rented below the average price for comparable properties in the neighbourhood. Because the annual increase of the rent doesn&#x2019;t keep pace with the market evolution. Obviously, in this case it&#x2019;s difficult to justify a substantial increase of the rent, whereas it&#x2019;s simpler with a new lease. For instance, it&#x2019;s easier to renovate an unoccupied apartment considerably.</p>\n<p>If your tenant doesn&#x2019;t wreak havoc on the apartment and if he pays promptly, he&#x2019;s a &#x201C;good tenant.&#x201D; However, to make the tenant&#x2019;s rent worthwhile it should be in line with the market average price.</p>\n<h3>Demonstration</h3>\n<p>I imagine you frown and you may think a rented apartment is better than an unoccupied one. All right, let&#x2019;s play this game! In Vincent&#x2019;s case, our fictitious investor, we assume his tenant pays a $650 rent whereas the market average is $950. This represents a 30% difference, and annually it means a $3600 cash flow loss.</p>\n<p>For some people, this amount may appear trivial compared to the financial loss caused by an unoccupied apartment for months. Even worse, compared to a tenant who damages the premises or who doesn&#x2019;t pay the rent on time. According to me, the figures speak more for themselves than the speculations. As for the amount of $3600, it&#x2019;s similar to an &#x201C;annual subsidy&#x201D; to Vincent&#x2019;s tenant. In fact, this is equivalent to more than three months of rent if the apartment were rented at fair market value.</p>\n<p>Keeping a &#x201C;subsidized&#x201D; tenant consists in the best decision in the following instance: Vincent knows that each year the apartment will stay unoccupied more than three months per year, because it&#x2019;s rented $950. Though, I doubt the apartment will stay unoccupied for more than three months a year.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/analytics.svg\"><span>Scenarios</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Not optimized apartment</span><ul><li><span>Monthly Rent</span><span> $650</span></li><li><span>Annual Income</span><span> $7800</span></li><li><span>Lost Income</span><span> -$3600</span></li><li><span>Vacancy Risk</span><span> $0</span></li></ul></div><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Optimized apartment</span><ul><li><span>Monthly Rent</span><span> $950</span></li><li><span>Annual Income</span><span> $11,400</span></li><li><span>Lost Income</span><span> -$0</span></li><li><span>Vacancy Risk</span><span> -$2850</span></li></ul></div></div></div>\n<p>For those who claim that a rented apartment to an unsuitable tenant is worse than just an unoccupied apartment, it often turns out to be true. Nevertheless, there is not much chance of a tenant damaging the premises, so that it costs Vincent $3600 annually. In my experience, a &#x201C;subsidized&#x201D; tenant would most likely damage the premises and have a lack of consideration for personal property real value.</p>\n<h3>Financial Impacts Of A &#x201C;Subsidized&#x201D; Apartment</h3>\n<p>A &#x201C;subsidized&#x201D; apartment affects negatively a building&#x2019;s net worth. It also impacts the possibility to mobilize unused equity to buy other properties.</p>\n<p>I should point out that the economic value is roughly 16&#x2013;17.5 times the net incomes. This value, established by banks, according to revenues and expenditures, helps to determine the amount of the mortgage you may take out.</p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s to say, according to Vincent example, a $3600 liquidity loss theoretically represents a loss of value varying between $57,600 and $63,000. As well, Vincent could use around 80% of this amount as a guarantee or as a down payment to buy a second building. So, it&#x2019;s a loss of $46,000 which doesn&#x2019;t provide returns on investment.</p>\n<p>As for this second building, it should generate, as an annual cash flow, approximately 3%-5% on the down payment, i.e. around an additional $2000 (considering 3%-5% of $46,000).</p>\n<p>Lastly, we do not take into account the capitalization of the second multifamily building&#x2019;s mortgage nor its appreciation, which could easily generate an additional $6000 to $10,000 annually.</p>\n<div class=\"contextual_help\"><div class=\"contextual_help_icon\"><img class=\"svg svg-fill\" src=\"https://mrex.co/le-contenu/themes/mrex/images/svg/analytics.svg\"><span>Scenarios</span></div><div class=\"contextual_help_content\"><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Not Optimized Apartment</span><ul><li><span>EV</span><span> $124,800</span></li><li><span>Available guarantee</span><span> $99,840</span></li><li><span>Cash flow (4%)</span><span> $3993</span></li></ul></div><div class=\"scenario\"><span>Optimized Apartment</span><ul><li><span>EV</span><span> $182,400</span></li><li><span>Available guarantee</span><span> $145,920</span></li><li><span>Cash flow (4%)</span><span> $5836</span></li></ul></div></div></div>\n<p>We realize now that this &#x201C;subsidized&#x201D; tenant causes a great financial loss! This is not only in terms of profitability, but in terms of input/output ratio, and regarding the real estate portfolio overall growth.</p>\n<p>To provide us with the means to match up our goals, we should be aware that such situation has potential impacts! Of course, increasing the rent or letting go this &#x201C;subsidized&#x201D; tenant involves some complex procedures and this article is not a how-to guide. Though, I am pretty sure that with a bit of resourcefulness you&#x2019;ll find on your own.
